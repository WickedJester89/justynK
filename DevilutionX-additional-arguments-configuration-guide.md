Optionally you can create a shortcut to that file .

### The following paragraphs will explain the arguments and their effects:

# [Help]


### `-h, --help`
The game will run and show a text help screen that briefly explains the arguments and then will terminate.


### `--version`
The game will run and show a text help screen that gives the game version and then will terminate.


# [ConfigDir]


### `--data-dir`
The game will run searching for the data files (diabdat.mpq, hellfire.mpq, etc.) in the specified folder path. This argument is used for both Diablo and Hellfire. This means that if you wish to play Hellfire, its .mpq  files must be located in the same path as diabdat.mpq.


### `--save-dir `          
The game will run and use the specified path after the argument as a save folder. Might need to be run with administrator permissions to be able to save in the desired path.


### `--config-dir`
The game will run looking in the specified folder for the diablo.ini configuration file. If the file doesn’t exist one will be created. Might need administrator permissions to write in the desired folder.


### `--ttf-dir`
The game will run looking for its default font used for displaying system messages and credits in the specified path.


### `--ttf-name`
The game will run with the specific font of your choosing to display system messages and credits. You need to specify path and filename.


# [Game]


### `-n`
The game will skip all intro videos


### `-f`
The game will run with fps counter in upper-left corner.


### `-x`
The game will run in windowed mode.


### `--spawn`
The game will be forced to run in Diablo:spawn mode even if diabdat.mpq exist. This allow you to explore only the cathedral level with the warrior. It features all the limitations of the original diablo spawn.


# [Hellfire]


### `--diablo`

The game will run in Diablo mode even if Hellfire data files are present along diabdat.mpq in either current or specified data-dir.


### `--nestart`

The game will use an alternative palette for the Hellfire’s nest tileset. This option is similar to the command.txt from the original expansion.
